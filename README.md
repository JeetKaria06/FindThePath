# FindThePath
This project is implementation of **concepts** learned in **Data Structures And Algorithm (DSA)** course. And helps in making **Dijkstra algorithm's** application understandable even to non-technical person i.e. **layman**.

This project has its code written in **JAVA**, with backend in **MySQL** and frontend in **javafxml with HTML and CSS combined**.
This project was our **SEM III project** of **Data Structures And Algorithms** course.
